Fotopedia is <a href="http://blog.fotopedia.com/fotopedia-shutdown/">shutting down</a>. It was a great site and I am sad that it's going to disappear. But I admit upfront - I write this article hoping to attract some of the photographers who used to publish at Fotopedia. They are now googling phrases like <strong>Fotopedia alternative</strong> or <strong>Fotopedia replacement</strong> and I hope they might consider publishing some of their photographs here at <i>Unexplored Paradises</i>.

Obviously, I am not trying to build anything like Fotopedia here. This site is a lot smaller, simpler and less ambitious. But it is my goal to continue building this photo collection of beautiful and interesting places around the world. I will keep publishing small sets of photographs hoping they can help travelers find inspiration for their next adventures. Some of you might like it even though it lacks the features that Fotopedia had.

Not what you are looking for? Here is <strong>the list of Fotopedia alternatives</strong> (although none can replace Fotopedia):
