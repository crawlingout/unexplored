Fotopedia is <a href="http://blog.fotopedia.com/fotopedia-shutdown/">shutting down</a>. It was a great site and I am sad that it's going to disappear. But I admit upfront - I write this because I'm trying to get the attention of the photographers who used to publish at Fotopedia. They are now googling phrases like <strong>Fotopedia alternative</strong> or <strong>Fotopedia replacement</strong> and I hope they might consider publishing some of their photographs here at <i>Unexplored Paradises</i>.

I am not trying to build anything like Fotopedia. This site is a lot smaller, simpler and less ambitious. I just keep posting small sets of photographs of interesting places around the world hoping to inspire travelers.

Not what you are looking for? Here is <strong>the list of Fotopedia alternatives</strong> (although none can replace Fotopedia):
