Fotopedia is <a href="http://blog.fotopedia.com/fotopedia-shutdown/">shutting down</a>. It was a great site and I am sad that it's going to disappear. But I admit upfront - I write this article hoping to attract some of the photographers who used to publish at Fotopedia. They are now googling phrases like <strong>Fotopedia alternative</strong> or <strong>Fotopedia replacement</strong> and I hope they might consider publishing some of their photographs here at <i>Unexplored Paradises</i>.

Obviously, I am not trying to build anything like Fotopedia here. This site is a lot smaller, simpler and less ambitious. But it is my goal to continue building this photo collection of beautiful and interesting places around the world. I will keep publishing small sets of photographs hoping they can help travelers find inspiration for their next adventures. Maybe some of you will like it even though it lacks a lot of the features that Fotopedia had.
