<strong>Dear travelers</strong>,<br />
I think we can help each other discover beautiful places around the world.

I love to travel. I live in the Czech Republic and recently went on a trip to White Carpathians, a range of mountains along the border between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The trip was awesome: hills, forests, incredible sights, everything was so beautiful. But, what surprised me was the fact that nobody else was there. I walked around for two days and only met five or six hikers, all of them from the Czech Republic or Slovakia.

When travelers from all over the world come to the Czech Republic, they all go to Prague. There are so many other beautiful places here: romantic ruins of medieval castles, deep forests and marvelous little towns. There are places many foreign tourists do not know about. Places like these...

When I am the foreigner in my travels to Spain or England, I go to places everyone else goes. I am sure I miss a lot and to be honest, I don't like places crowded with tourists, full of souvenir shops and expensive restaurants. I like places that still have a distinct atmosphere. The places only locals and experienced wanderers know about.

There are a lot of sites where you can find info about Paris, Rome or Barcelona. Everyone knows about the Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal, Machu Picchu and the pyramids. I want to create a site where travelers, backpackers and nomads can seek inspiration for their next adventure and let each other know about awesome places that are relatively unknown.

Do you want to help me and <a href="../submit">let me know</a> about locations like that? I will try to build a collection of places worth visiting. We can help each other discover unexplored paradises of the world.
