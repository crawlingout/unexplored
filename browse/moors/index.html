    <h4>Moors</h4>
    <p>
        The Moors were the medieval Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, Iberian Peninsula, Sicily and Malta. They invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 and called the territory Al-Andalus, an area which at different times comprised Gibraltar, most of Spain and Portugal, and parts of Southern France. The religious difference of the Moorish Muslims led to a centuries-long conflict with the Christian kingdoms of Europe called the Reconquista. The Fall of Granada in 1492 saw the end of the Muslim rule in Iberia.
