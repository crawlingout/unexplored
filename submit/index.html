        If you know about some interesting locations, it would be greatly appreciated if you would let me know so I can include it in this collection of beautiful places.

        If you want to share your pictures (and that would be awesome!), the easiest way is to put them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons</a> license and send me a link.

        It goes without saying, that I will credit you as the author. If you want a link to your website, (for example if you wish to promote your travel blog), please don't forget to send me your URL.
