        You can also send a link to images at <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> if they are under a permissive license.<br />
        Even without images, a tip for others about some interesting place would be greatly appreciated.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can include several photos from the same trip. Preferably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging">geotagged</a> - we need to know the <strong>location</strong> of the unexplored paradise you discovered. If your photographs are not geotagged, please tell us where they are from.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want a link to your website (for example if you wish to promote your travel blog), include your URL.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please make sure that you have all necessary <strong>rights and permissions</strong> to submit these photographs and have them posted. We do not want to violate any intellectual property rights of any third party.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you.</p>
